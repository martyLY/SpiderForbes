As we seek to decarbonize, more of our economy electrifies and more of the load shifts to the grid. In the U.S., this is a really big deal. Hovering around 4,100 terawatt hours, most Americans probably do not realize that our national power consumption has been flat since The Great Recession of 2007-2009. No wonder then that the coal industry might be electric cars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd biggest fan. \", \"A overwhelming statistic illustrates our Herculean task for electric cars: we have 270 million oil-based cars (i.e., internal combustion engine) and only around 2 million that run on electricity.

Packing a mighty punch, oil-based gasoline\\u00a0has \", \"\\u00a0of a lithium-ion battery utilized in electric cars. \", \"Experts at the University of California, Berkeley calculate that by 2050 the U.S. will need almost 90% more electricity than it did in 2018, in a scenario where all new passenger vehicles sold by 2030 are electric, with buildings and factories also electrifying quickly. This analysis is part of a\\u00a0\", \"\\u00a0looking at what it would take to make the power grid 90% carbon-free by 2035. \", \"Again, none of this is hard to imagine.

This could mean hundreds of thousands of solar farms and wind turbines, many more nuclear plants, 10s of gigawatts of storage batteries, weatherization of our systems, thousands of miles of high-voltage transmission lines, and other infrastructure that many of our policymakers have previously opposed. \", \"For sure, however, now easily the main source of U.S. power generation at 40%, natural gas will remain integral. Gas continues as an important fuel for baseload power, although today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds large combined cycle plants could be eventually displaced by more smaller-scale, quick-start combustion turbines that can compensate for localized intermittency from wind and solar. Our electrification goals could also probably use gas plants paired with onsite storage, as is under consideration in Texas with the Warren Buffet $8.3 billion plan for emergency power from gas. \\u00a0\", \"And to meet the proposed Clean Electricity Standard and carbon-free power by 2035 being promoted by the Biden administration, carbon capture and storage is getting more notice, especially since it enjoys bipartisan support (sadly, something that is becoming increasingly rare in today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds politics). \", \"Decarbonized electrification is probably our defining climate challenge of the coming decades, so dismissing solutions out of hand could prove a catastrophic mistake far beyond what we saw in Texas. As extreme weather worsens and makes all of this more difficult, the reality is that each state will likely need to double its power capacity to meet our electrification climate goal. \", \"Meeting the electrification challenge is a matter of our three \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd for national security: energy, environment, and economic.
