Five years later, she graced the cover of Forbes thanks to her booming mobile game, which helped her earn $51 million that year. Now, she officially joins the World\\u2019s Billionaires list for the first time.Forbes estimates that Kardashian West is now worth $1 billion, up from $780 million in October, thanks to two lucrative businesses\\u2014KKW Beauty and Skims\\u2014as well as cash from reality television and endorsement deals, and a number of smaller investments. Kardashian West founded KKW Beauty in 2017, following the success of her half-sister Kylie Jenner\\u2019s Kylie Cosmetics. She borrowed from Kylie\\u2019s playbook, using a similar direct-to-consumer model that relies heavily on social media marketing. Her first launch, 300,000 contour kits, sold out within two hours. By 2018, the business had expanded into eyeshadows, concealers, lipsticks and fragrances, and was bringing in about $100 million in revenue.It\\u2019s the first time I've moved away from having licensing deals and transitioned into being an owner, Kardashian West told Forbes in 2017, when she announced her cosmetics line.She cashed in on that ownership last year when she sold 20% of KKW Beauty to cosmetics conglomerate Coty for $200 million, a deal that valued the company at $1 billion. While Forbes estimates that figure is a little bloated\\u2014Coty, which also bought 51% of Kylie Cosmetics in 2020, is known for overpaying\\u2014her remaining 72% stake is still worth about $500 million, by our count. Then there\\u2019s Skims, the shapewear line Kardashian West launched in 2019. She raised money from fashion insiders like Net-a-Porter\\u2019s Natalie Massane and Theory\\u2019s Andrew Rosen, and capitalized on her massive social media following to shill the brand. (She now has 69.6 million Twitter followers and 213 million followers on Instagram.) Skims has been quick on its feet: During the pandemic, when consumers became more interested in comfy clothes for the couch than in smoothing their stomachs under evening gowns, she swiftly started turning the focus to loungewear.Kardashian West owns a majority stake in closely-held Skims, which hasn\\u2019t disclosed its revenues. A source familiar with Skims told Forbes about a transaction that values the shapewear company north of $500 million. As a result, Forbes estimates her Skims stake is worth a conservative $225 million, enough to lift her fortune to $1 billion. The rest of Kardashian West\\u2019s fortune sits in cash and investments, including real estate. Every year since 2012, she has earned at least $10 million pretax, by Forbes\\u2019 count, thanks to paychecks from Keeping Up With the Kardashians, endorsement deals and endeavors like the aforementioned mobile game and her now-defunct Kimoji app. She\\u2019s also got three properties in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles, and a portfolio of blue-chip investments, including shares of Disney, Amazon, Netflix and Adidas that her soon-to-be ex-husband Kanye West gifted her for Christmas in 2017. But it\\u2019s the companies that she has launched herself, and grown with the typical Kardashian flare for self-promotion, that land her on the World\\u2019s Billionaires list. As she tweeted the day she made the cover of Forbes, mocking the criticism she\\u2019s received for years: \\u201cNot bad for a girl with no talent.\\u201d\"}}"
