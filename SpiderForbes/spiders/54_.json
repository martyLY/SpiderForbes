McDonnell, Jr., M.B.A.\", \"content\": [\"Brian Cashman, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the \", \", made himself available to the media on an off day prior to the start of a two-game series against the Atlanta Braves. As his ball club currently has the second worst record (5-10) in Major League Baseball trailing only the Colorado Rockies (4-12), Cashman knows the Yankees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd offense is the primary reason for the overall poor performance. Even though the offensive struggles have exposed additional weaknesses in terms of pitching, defense, and baserunning, Cashman believes the Yankees will turn it around and everyone will see different results by the end of the month.\", \"Cashman\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds exchange with the media was not enlightening by any stretch of the imagination. It was an obvious acknowledgement that below average performances by several well-paid ball players are currently making the Yankees a vulnerable and desirable opponent. Specific solutions were not presented to confront the mounting problems the Yankees are facing, but assurances were made there is disappointment among the ball club\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds hierarchy. \", \"The Yankees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd offensive deficiencies are most evident in \", \". Presently, the Yankees (.642) are tied with the Texas Rangers for the worst OPS in Major League Baseball according to FanGraphs. Baseball-Reference.com paints an ominous picture for the Yankees based on 3.67 runs per game along with a 6.3% extra base hit percentage (XBH%), both well below league averages. These statistics demonstrate an ineptitude that is uncharacteristic of a ball club predicated on power. \\u00a0\", \"Even though it is a team effort regarding the Yankees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd lethargic start to the 2021 season, one cannot help but wonder as to where they need to see immediate improvement. In terms of offensive production with an emphasis on OPS, where are the Yankees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd greatest needs? Who needs to step up?\", \"According to Baseball-Reference.com, there are only three Yankees based on qualified plate appearances whose OPS is above the American League average (.694): Aaron Judge (.831), DJ LeMahieu (.786), and Gary Sanchez (.777). The American League team position performance by OPS identifies keys areas of improvement for the Yankees as well as a few surprises. They have the second-best position performance in terms of OPS by a catcher (.939), but most of this statistic is being driven by backup Kyle Higashioka\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds 1.284 OPS over 16 plate appearances. \", \"There are causes for concern regarding poor OPS production from the center field, left field, shortstop, and first base positions. The Yankees are currently thirteenth in the American League with a .538 OPS from three center fielders with Aaron Hicks playing an overwhelming majority of the time (55 of the 63 plate appearances). After finally earning an everyday starting position and essentially replacing Brett Gardner, Clint Frazier has struggled with a .472 OPS over 40 plate appearances. Three left fielders for the Yankees have produced a combined .526 OPS, twelfth overall in the American League in terms of team position performance by OPS. \\u00a0\", \"Gleyber Torres has a produced a .552 OPS over 60 plate appearances. The combination of Torres and Gio Urshela at shortstop have achieved a .515 OPS for the Yankees. Only the Oakland Athletics (.348) have a worse team position performance at shortstop in the American League according to Baseball-Reference.com. In all fairness to Urshela, he only contributed four plate appearances to this statistic. The combination of Urshela and LeMahieu at third base has produced an .865 OPS which ranks third in the American League. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"The sudden retirement of Jay Bruce and Luke Voit\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds recovery from surgery to repair a partially torn meniscus in his left knee has the Yankees utilizing LeMahieu at first base. Mostly due to Bruce\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds ineffectiveness, the Yankees currently have the worst first base performance in the American League with a .458 OPS. LeMahieu has also played second base and third base this season. Rougned Odor will now see time at second base. Will Odor be able to replicate or exceed LeMahieu\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds OPS production when he plays second base?\", \"Unlike the Boston Red Sox (1.167) and Minnesota Twins (1.119) who are enjoying outstanding OPS production out of the designated hitter position primarily thanks to JD Martinez and Nelson Cruz, the Yankees are floundering with Giancarlo Stanton (.609). As a ball club, the Yankees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd .561 OPS from the designated hitter position ranks eleventh in the American League according to Baseball-Reference.com. Even though Stanton is electrifying fans with eye popping exit velocities, he has struggled to find consistency in the early weeks of the season. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"The New York Yankees have rightfully earned the nickname, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdBronx Bombers,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd thanks to generations of prolific home run hitters and iconic sluggers. Now, it appears as if the Yankees are trying to bludgeon their way out of a prolonged slump instead of making the necessary adjustments through situational hitting. Manager Aaron Boone has made a few bold lineup changes in the Yankees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd first game against the Atlanta Braves by starting Brett Gardner in center field, Mike Tauchman in left field, and Mike Ford at first base. It only takes one at bat to ignite a spark as the Yankees need to start a productive offensive streak before heading out on an eight game road trip against the Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles.\"]}}"
