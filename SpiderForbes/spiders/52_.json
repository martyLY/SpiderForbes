S. and a possible foray into the resale space.\", \"author\": \"Sharon Edelson\", \"content\": [\"Three months after its initial pubic offering on the New York Stock Exchange, German luxury retailer Mytheresa is eying growth in the U.S., continued expansion of its menswear business, and a strong slate of exclusive capsule collections and pre-launches with top designers.\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe already have a presence in the U.S. and we want to grow it. The U.S. is a very attractive market for luxury,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd said Mytheresa CEO Michael Kliger, in an exclusive interview. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe luxury space is one of the late comers to digital. According to research 4% of all luxury goods were historically sold online. Last year, it rose from 10% to 12%, and it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds poised to reach 30 % by 2025.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \", \"Since the Covid-19 pandemic, there\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds been a shift in consumer demand for luxury fashion. Clients find shopping online more convenient and efficient, and they\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre finding inspiration on e-commerce sites. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIn the U.S., large multi-brand boutiques have never been as strong as they are in Europe,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThere\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds this desire for curation, someone doing the hard work and saying, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSo you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre interested in a black clutch and floral dress...\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"The pandemic has accelerated consumers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd migration online, Klieger said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLike many crises in the past, it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds separating the good from the not so good players,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd he said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdA lot of consolidation is happening. I strongly believe we\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdll look back on the last 12 months and say, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThat was a pivotal moment.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"While digital retailers are benefiting from store closures, luxury brands such as Mytheresa are missing the impact of red carpets, which have all but ceased to exist during the crisis.\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdA lot of designer and luxury fashion is driven by festivities, special locations, travel to exotic locations, and cruise. A lot depends on consumer sentiment. European consumer sentiment is improving rapidly,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt know if this has to do with the positive news on the vaccination front. \", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWhat we\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdve seen over the last 10 months is that consumer patterns shifted,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger added. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThere were less clutches and ballgowns. There was a category shift. People went online, but it reflected this forced-upon change in lifestyle. We now see plenty of demand for high heels, [day] dresses and cocktail dresses.\", \"The velocity of sales depends on when charities come back. Brands with multiple product categories are seen as making a swifter transition to some measure of pre-pandemic business. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdBigger brands such as Gucci, Prada or Saint Laurent, which also sell sneakers, can change buying patterns within the brand,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe bigger brands that offer fantastic knitwear, can switch to dresses.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"Kliger said Mytheresa has a history of pivoting, and chasing new opportunities. Resale isn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt on the table now, but Klinger\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds aware of its growing popularity. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThere\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds clearly a need for these platforms to clean out the wardrobe, so to speak,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWhy not turn these clothes into money, or why shouldn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt that piece make someone else happy. There\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds this\\u00a0reality of freeing up some cash. I don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt want to wear it for whatever reason, but someone else can enjoy it. How can I sell this without too much paperwork and feeling like I\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdm an eBay seller.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"Some Mytheresa clients have separate rooms for their clothing. Certain handbags may be good for 10 years, but ready-to-wear cycles are shorter. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt we look at it as an opportunity for us,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe only deal in mint products now.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"Mytherea, which does the majority of its business online and through digital commerce, and operates two stores in Munich. The women\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds boutique opened in 1987. For years, Mytheresa catered exclusively to women, until last year, when it launched men\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds wear. To demonstrate it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds commitment to the category, it unveiled a men\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds boutique in April 2020. \", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTen percent of our business is in men\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds wear after a year,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe have no plans to open more physical stores. It\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds a set of priorities. We still have opportunities in digital and we\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre focusing on expanding and growing our digital business. But, don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt say, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnever.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"As is typical in luxury, there\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds a high concentration in the customer group of top spenders. Almost 3 percent of customers account for 30% of Mytheresa\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds business.\", \"Not all customers want to work a stylist. They can research products directly from the showroom. Before the pandemic, Mytheresa held dinners for clients with the likes of Stella McCartney, Victoria Beckham, Olivier Rousteing of Balman, and Caroline Herrera creative director Wes Gordon.\", \" \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis is one of our key characteristics, that we offer top customers access to the luxury world,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Kliger said, adding that he\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds looking forward, post- Covid, when the events can resume. \", \"Mytheresa injects exclusives into its buys that other players don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt carry. While the site buys deep into bestsellers, only 25% of its overall assortment overlaps with competitors such as Netaporter.com and Maches.com, Kliger said, adding, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe want to present an elevated and exclusive collection you don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt find elsewear.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"For example, the retailer this year offered an outerwear capsule with Burberry and exclusive styles from Bottega Veneta. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe even had a capsule collection of Jimmy Choo x Marine Serre, with pieces only available at Mytheresa, and we ran customizations with Gucci\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Ace sneaker with monogram inserts. With Chloe, we did a customization in a predefined way, and it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds bespoke.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\"]}}"
