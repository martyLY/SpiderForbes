After years of crafting beverages in his own kitchen for athlete and celebrity clients so he could get them the antioxidants, vitamins and electrolytes they needed, Malik decided to bring his formulations to the public.\", \"Malik says he started making beverages for athletes to help them recover after injury or enhance their performance without resorting to pharmaceuticals. Kuzma was just one of the many athletes he\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds worked with over the years who\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdve benefited from his formulations.\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI asked myself, what are we giving them to drive that 1% change? I thought about all the people that are paid to support these athletes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddieticians, sports medicine specialists, osteopaths\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdand when we\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre trying to mitigate their recovery or enhance their performance, a lot of the products that we\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre giving out could be given in a different way, not in a pill form.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"Malik says he started to look at what athletes were given, breaking down what they needed to drive their recovery but thinking of healthier alternatives for delivering those nutrients. He says he was always interested in the chemistry side of sports nutrition products from a young age, but it wasn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt until his mother had cancer and was undergoing treatment that it really started to click for him.\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThey were giving her things like ginseng and other types of adaptogens to help her get through radiation. I thought to myself, if these people suffer the most because of the treatment, why is it we don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt have the same type of product at a smaller level\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda nontoxic level\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdto stimulate enough of the antiviral, the anti-inflammatory, the antioxidant chemistry so we can continue to improve our strength?\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThen I thought about the athletic performance side with electrolytes, different types of carbohydrates, fats, amino acids and things they need to perform at a very high level, and then it made sense to add B6, B12, Vitamin D and adaptogens to strengthen your immune system. In today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds world, immunity is everything, and I felt like we had an opportunity to not just be a sports beverage.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"Malik says he kept coming back to the need for a plant-based product that would benefit not only athletes but also the average consumer. The beverages have fungus and mushrooms dissolved in them, but the only way the gut can consume these nutrients properly is with good bacteria that can be found in plants. Additives and preservatives found in other sports drinks can take away the positive functionalities, so Barcode decided to go all in on being plant-based.\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI thought about chronic illness and different types of diseases that can be prevented from certain substrates, and it all comes back to plants and their implications on stress and anxiety and really tapping into the adaptive components that allow you to mitigate stress and anxiety. The research supports adaptogens as a leader in this space. If you have Vitamin D from a different source other than a plant, then the magnesium and some of the other mushroom extracts won\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt be dissolved correctly.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"Special attention was paid to creating a product that both athletes and the average consumer could benefit from, even though pro athletes are likely working at a much higher caloric level than the average person in a desk job. \", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre here to support everyday performers by providing a product that works with your body,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Malik says.\", \"From testing the product on athletes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdincluding Kuzma, who won a 2020 NBA championship with the Lakers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdto ensuring calories and sugar were kept low for the average consumer who might be doing intermittent fasting or the keto diet, Barcode was formulated to help anyone feel healthier and perform better in whatever context they need.\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe have an obesity epidemic, and so many have heart disease and diabetes, and this is usually because of an overload of sugar, stress and your environment. I was mindful when I was formulating this to stay within 30 calories, two grams of sugar and four kinds of carbohydrates.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"The first thing Malik did was test the flavor on athletes he was working with to ensure that his all-natural product tasted good.\", \"\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe first thing was taste. The product had to taste good. And then once we got the taste right, the second part was asking [the athletes], how did it make you feel? Does it go down smooth? Does it feel good in your gut? Is there a bad aftertaste? If Gatorade was healthy, it would taste like this.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"Barcode\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds two introductory flavors are watermelon and lemon lime. The beverages are sweetened with monk fruit and include all-natural, non-GMO ingredients such as coconut water, adaptogens and Vitamin D sourced through mushrooms. \", \"The bottles are equipped with an AR-enabled customer experience that allows users to scan a QR code on the bottle cap to receive curated content. Consumers can purchase the product on Barcode\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds \", \".\"]}}"
