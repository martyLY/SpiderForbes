After many months where that didn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt seem to make a big difference in my home viewing habits, I\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdve more recently found myself much less excited about my binge-watching choices. When you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre spending hours with middle-of-the-road off-network product from 2017 (names withheld), it was clearly time to be a bit more adventurous. \", \"I\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdve hardly been a trend-setter here, but have plunged voraciously into the world of international programming \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the stuff Americans have long segregated into the niche of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsubtitled stuff.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd With my limited memories of nine years of French language study and warmer ones of business trips to Cannes and Provence\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds wine offerings, I dove quickly into French fare. This is no niche market anymore as Netflix \\n \", \" recently announced a doubling of its original programming investments in France and the opening of an office in Paris.\", \"The first stop in my French programming voyage was \", \"on Netflix (of course). They had me at \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdBonjour.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \", \"The delights of \", \" (\", \" if you will) are both specific to this program and more widely representative of the rewards of diving into the new worlds there for the taking in the global Connected TV market. The show will seem happily familiar in its structure and character development, and yet refreshingly different at the same time. \", \"There are few things that Hollywood loves to produce more than movies and TV shows about the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbusiness.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd This runs from historic films like \", \", \", \" and \", \" to TV series from \", \" to \", \" to \", \" to Aaron Sorkin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds \", \"and \", \". In that sense \", \" fits in very comfortably into that milieu, with its agents focused on the care and feeding of their star clients, ensuring their own agency\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds financial success and dodging a variety of personal and business problems often of their own making. And it takes place with a group of memorably lovable characters and wonderful actors previously unknown \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd at least to me \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd before seeing them here. \", \"And yet\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdso much is different. The settings are unmistakably French, from pre-pandemic Parisian cafes to the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. There is an entirely unremarked upon and yet \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd for a U.S. audience \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd infrequently seen appearance of so many interracial couples. Most interestingly, and even the midst of an often ruthless, unforgiving show business, one of the animating passions shared by the partners in the fictional ASK firm is the love of film as art. There is a wonderful and surprising working relationship between two seemingly mismatched partners with the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdold hand\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd tutoring the other on the marriage of great music, great film and great commercial success. It\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds pretty nigh impossible to imagine an American-based series with even occasionally altruistic and art-driven agents. A warm and fuzzy fictional CAA or Endeavor? We\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre definitely not in Kansas here \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or Beverly Hills.\", \"The show benefits from a wonderful series of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdguest stars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd from the world of French TV and cinema, most of whom are likely unknown in the U.S. but clearly icons in France. While U.S. shows often deploy surprising and humorous guest star appearances, those in \", \" (including one from an utterly delightful Sigourney Weaver) require the stars to play extremely high-maintenance and satirical versions of their own personas. There\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds not a lot of U.S. stars \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd especially in their senior years \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd simultaneously featured with such respect and irreverence. \", \"The translations you see in subtitles eliminate any challenges of language understanding. Yet there is a peculiar joy when you know only a little of a language and still find yourself picking up on what the characters are saying \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd even without the subtitles. If I was fluent in French, I wouldn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt need the \", \" subtitles, and if I knew none of the language, I\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdd have no clue without them.

I am, however, always open to suggestions.
