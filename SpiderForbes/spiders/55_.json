Last year alone, 16,628 candidates applied to both schools; just 1,520 gained an acceptance, a mere 9.1% admit rate.\", \"Business school admissions are holistic, meaning that while standardized test scores and undergraduate transcripts are a critical part of the admissions process, they aren\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt the whole story. In fact, the stories that applicants tell the schools in the form of essays can be a critical component of a successful application.\", \"So what kinds of stories are successful applicants to Harvard and Stanford telling their admission officers? For the first time ever, a newly published collection of 50 of these essays from current MBA students at these two schools has been published. In ten cases, applicants share the essays they wrote in applying to both schools so you can see whether they merely did a cut-and-paste job or approached the task anew. The 188-page book, \", \" gains its title from the two iconic essay prompts at Harvard and Stanford. \", \"\\u00a0\", \"Stanford can easily boast having the most difficult question posed to MBA applicants in any given year: In 650 words or less, candidates must tell the school what matters most to them and why. Harvard gives applicants ample room to hang themselves, providing no word limit at all, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWhat more would you like us to know as we consider your candidacy?\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"One makes this unusual collection of essays powerful are the thoughtful critiques by the founders of two MBA admissions consulting firms, Jeremy Shinewald of mbaMission and Lisa Weale of Gatehouse Admissions. They write overviews of each essay in the book and then tear apart portions by paragraphs to either underline a point or address a weakness. \", \" for $60 a pop.\", \"As I note in a foreword to the collection, published in partnership with \", \" the essay portion of an application is where a person can give voice to who they are, what they have achieved so far, and what they imagine their future to be. Yet crafting a powerful and introspective essay can be incredibly daunting as you stare at a blank computer screen.\\u00a0\", \"One successful applicant to Harvard Business School begins his essay by conveying a deeply personal story: The time his father was told that he had three months to live, with his only hope being a double lung transplant. had to undergo a lung transplant.

With growing unease, I noticed people and things that had not registered with me the night before and realized I had been so preoccupied with capturing the occasion on my phone that I had essentially missed the whole thing. I never learned the name of the woman beside me at the reception. I could not recall the wedding cake flavor. I never introduced myself to my friend\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds grandfather from Edmonton. I was so mortified that before checking into my flight, I turned my phone off and stuffed it into my carry-on.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\", \"The Stanford version of his essay is more compact. In truth, it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds more succinctly written and more satisfying because it is to the point.
