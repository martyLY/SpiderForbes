The downward trajectory has seen global executions fall to their lowest level in 10 years and some positive trends were noted in the Middle East. \", \"The number of executions in Saudi Arabia dropped by 85% between 2019 and 2020 while the number of people being put to death in Iraq more than halved. No executions were recorded in\\u00a0Bahrain, Belarus, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore or Sudan last year, countries that all made Amnesty's list in 2019. \", \"Unfortunately, the trend was not downward in every country and some governments increased the number of executions they carried out last year. Egypt is a chilling example and it tripled its execution count in 2020, putting 57 people to death. The United States was the only country in the Americas to use the death penalty last year and 17 executions were recorded. India, Oman, Qatar and Taiwan were also noteworthy for resuming executions in 2020. \", \"China remains the world's top user of capital punishment by a considerable distance. Even though it considers information on its executions and death sentences a state secret, it is believed to put thousands of prisoners to death every year. North Korea is another country where use of the death penalty is believed to be widespread, though it was not included on Amnesty's list due to a lack of data. \", \"After China and excluding North Korea, Iran is the most prolific executioner with at least 246 people put to death last year, followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia with at least 45 and 27 executions, respectively. Together, Iran, Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia accounted for 88% of all known executions globally in 2020. Amnesty states that the fall in executions is primarily due to reductions in some \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdretentionist\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd countries which habitually use capital punishment while the Covid-19 pandemic also played a role to a lesser extent, halting executions in some cases. \"]}}"
