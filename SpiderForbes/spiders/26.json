In Chicago, you can hear my health segments and business analysis on WBBM News Radio 780 and 105.9 FM. I've written for many media outlets, including the New York Times (2011-2013) and was healthcare reporter at the Chicago Tribune (1998-2011). Prior to that, I wrote for Modern Healthcare and several Iowa newspapers including the Des Moines Register. I'm active in education and teach in the University of Iowa School of Journalism MA in Strategic Communication program.
